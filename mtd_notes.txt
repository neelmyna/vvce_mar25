Next window, scroll down, on left bottom corner, click developer settings
Next window, on top left, Click personal access tokens, Click again on token Classic
Next window, Click on Generate new token button and select Tokens classic
(Now u may be asked to enter password)
Next, Add a note for the new PAT we are creating
Select Expiry -> No expiration
Select the Top check box named REPO
Scroll down fully and click the green button (generate token)
Now, copy the PAT
Come to your gmail and mail the PAT to yourself or to one of your own account (Mail Subject: GIT PAT)

Now, let us Sync our Remote Repo with Local Repo
In other words, we are going to CLONE our Repo using the PAT.
By doing so, we can perform Read-Write operations on our Remote Repo without having to Authenticate everytime.

$ git clone https://<PAT>@github.com/neelmyna/vvce_mar25

Commands required to upload files from local repo to remote:

$ git add .
// Git will mark all the files that need to be updated

$ git commit -m "notes file of the mtd training is added"
// Git creates an object that will inlclude all the files to be uploaded and also it is secured (encription)

$ git push origin main
// the object now is sent to the server (the remote repo is updated)
